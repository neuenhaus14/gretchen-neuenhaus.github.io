/** 
 * CONTROL FLOW
 * 0: Control Flow:
 * Control flow statements are used to control the flow of execution in a program. It is the order 
 * in which the code executes. Code is read from top to bottom unless redirected by conditionals or 
 * loops. Loops were mentioned in another section, but in regards to conditionals, if, else if, else,
 * and switch statements are used frequently to shift the control flow. 
 *
 *  
 * 1: if, else if, else statements 
 * These conditional statements are used to execute different actions based on different conditions.
 *     if statements: if a condition is true it is used to specify execution for a block of code.
 *     else if statements: if the first test is false, and these conditions are true, 
 *                         it executes the second block of code.
 *     else statements: if the previous tests failed, this block of code executes.
 *  
 * 
 * 2: Switch Statements
 * Another type of conditional that tests the value of an expression against multiple cases.
 * These statements are generally cleaner blocks of code over complicated if statements.
