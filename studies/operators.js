/** 
 OPERATORS
 0: Operators: Operators are pieces parts of code that are used with an expression to evaluate data values or 
 edit outcomes of code. The data values on either side of the operators are called operands. 

 
 1: Types: 
    Arithmetic Operators
    Assignment Operators
    Comparison Operators
    String Operators
    Logical Operators
    Ternary Operators
    Type Operators

 2: Uses: 
    Arithmetic Operators => used to do arithmetic using numbers.
    Assignment Operators => assign the left value of the operator to the right side
    Comparison Operators => The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values. These compare 
                            operands and return a Boolean based on if the comparison is true. 
    String Operators => concatenates (combines) two string values together and returns the new (combined) string 
    Logical Operators => typically used with Boolean values to return a boolean value
    Ternary Operators => only operator that only takes three operands. Can use it anywhere you would use a standard operator.
    Type Operators => returns a string indicating the type of the operand

// 1. Arithemetic Operators
var x = 2 + 2 // 4 
var y = 4 / 2 // 2 
var z = 2 * 2 // 4
var b = 4 - 2 // 2

// 2. Assignment Operators
var x = y // var x = y 
x += y; //  x = x + y
x -= y; //  x = x - y
x *= y; //  x = x * y
x /= y; //  x = x / y
x %= y; //  x = x % y

// 3. Comparison Operators

3 == "3" // Equal, resolves to true
2 != 

// 3: Hoisting: \
